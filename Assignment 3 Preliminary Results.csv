"FileName field is responsible for a proper naming and a proper format of your submitted file.
             The name of your submitted file must be the same as the name of the header provided to you.
             The file must NOT be compressed (archived).
             Violating these rules results in zero for the assignment.",,,,,,
"Compiled field states whether your code compiles successfully without any errors.
             If your code does not compile you get zero for the whole assignment.
             If your code compiles successfully you get +20 points.",,,,,,
"Tests-Run field shows how many tests could be run through your program.
             If all of the tests were run through your program succesfully you get +40 points. 
             If your program unexpectedly terminates before all of the test could be run
             you get +((number of successfully run tests) / (number of tests) * 40) points.
             If this field says “indefinite”, it means that your program never terminated
             And you get zero for the fields “Tests-Run”, “Tests-Correct”, and “V-Pen”. ",,,,,,
"Tests-Correct field shows how many tests were passed successfully.
             If all of the test were passed you get +40 points. 
             Otherwise, you get +((number of successfully passed tests) / (number of tests) * 40) points.
             If this field says “indefinite”, it means that your program never terminated

"V-Pen field is responsible for Valgrind check and it shows how many points subtracted as a penalty. 
             If your code does not cause any memory related errors you get -0 points.
             Otherwise, a bit convoluted formula is in use. 
             All you need to know is that the maximum amount of points that can be subtracted from 
             your final score is -30.
             If this field says “indefinite”, it means that your program caused Valgrind to freeze
             and you get -30 points.",,,,,,
FinalScore field shows your rounded final score.,,,,,,
