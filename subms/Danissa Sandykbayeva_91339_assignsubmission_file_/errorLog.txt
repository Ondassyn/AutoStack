==> valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:303 (get_bszB_as_is): Assertion 'bszB_lo == bszB_hi' failed.
==> valgrind: Heap block lo/hi size mismatch: lo = 96, hi = 18446744013580009459.
==> This is probably caused by your program erroneously writing past the
==> end of a heap block and corrupting heap metadata.  If you fix any
==> invalid writes reported by Memcheck, this assertion failure will
==> probably go away.  Please try that before reporting this as a bug.

==> Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
==> It contains workarounds to several common problems.
==> In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
==> identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance
==> that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
==> crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.
==> 
==> If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org
==> 
==> In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind
==> version, and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.
