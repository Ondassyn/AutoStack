==> This is probably caused by your program erroneously writing past the

==> Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
==> It contains workarounds to several common problems.
==> In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
==> identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance
==> that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
==> crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.
==> 
==> If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

==> In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind
==> version, and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.
